            <h1>Welcome, Comrade.</h1>
            <h2>Our mission is to prepare students for higher education and ensure success for all students taking the financial risk for a degree.</h2>
            <h3>Today, students are forced to gamble thousands of dollars towards a degree.</h3>
            <h3>My hypothesis is, if today's students share their course pathways, booklists, and reading guides for their specific major and school,</h3>
            <h3>then they can help increase the chance for success for future students by giving them a means to prepare prior to entering higher education institutions.</h3>
            <h3>Learning a new subject in 3 months is not ideal for everyone.</h3>
            <h3>Not everyone is talented, hardworking, or priveleged enough to have ample study time.</h3>
            <h3>Our mission is to provide resources and an opportunity for others to prepare prior to purchasing a course, so nobody gets left behind.</h3>
            <h3>Life doesn't have to be a competition. This can be a teamwork effort.</h3>
            <h3>We live together in the same space and time, so please join us in being comrades toward higher success rates in the higher education.</h3>
