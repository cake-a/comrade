#COMRADE
<strong>Comrade</strong> is a resource that enables current students to upload their major pathway, reading guides, booklists, and notes as a means to help prospective students get a leg up on studying and preparing for courses prior to payment
Today, students are forced to take a financial gamble towards higher education.
They  pay for courses, see the information for the first time, and are expected to pass in a single semester.

Through <strong>Comrade</strong>, students are able to have an overview of what they need to know prior to attending class, thus giving them an advantage and higher chance of passing said course.
Students that feel restricted and confined to one major can also explore other majors and broaden their knowledge by learning about what other students know.

At essense, <strong>Comrade</strong> is a compilation of everything a student needs to succeed in university or college.
